### 👋 Hi, I'm Puspa

I build backend applications with Python and Django.  
Lately, I've been exploring different parts of backend development — APIs, databases, and writing clean code.

Just a developer from a small corner of the world 🌍, looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and work on real projects.
